# Robot
We ran multiple tests on a robot to try and keep it on track of the different courses. We experimented with the code and had many different cases of trial and error before we were able to be on track. We kept track of the things we changed in the code each time it was run. 
The objective of this project is to write code for a robot to roll around three "events" while recording location nad orientation data to make sure it stayed on track.
